        <h2>Who could be a Jon Snow on Earth?</h2>
        <p>Winter is coming to Westeros, but disappearing on Earth. Both worlds’ most pressing problems involve a rejection of information gathered on the front lines, migrations of vulnerable populations that unsettle adjacent communities, and a potential tipping point past which there is no hope of survival. </p>
        <p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/game-of-thrones-climate-change-white-walkers-global-warming" target="_blank">Vox matched up some Game of Thrones characters with their real-world climate warrior counterparts.</a> But who do you think is going to be the Jon Snow who can save us all? </p>
      </div>

      <div class="intro" id="tyrion">
        <h2> Leonardo Dicaprio as Tyrion Lannister</h2>
        <p>Tyrion is a former denier—“I don’t believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the wall”—who is now fighting for good by backing Daenerys and, one presumes, her eventual battle against the wights. Meanwhile, DiCaprio used to terrorize L.A. nightclubs with the Pussy Posse before gradually turning more conscientious and making Before the Flood, a film that offers not only information about climate change, but practical ways to fight it. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="intro" id="daenerys">
        <h2> Angela Merkel as Daenerys Targaryen</h2>
        <p>Khaleesi has dragons, and Merkel also has a powerful weapon in her arsenal: she was a scientist for more than a decade, earning her doctorate in physical chemistry in 1986. In May, Merkel confronted Trump about his promise to pull out of the Paris accord, saying, “We Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands.” Plus, George W. Bush would probably try to give actress Emilia Clarke a back rub, too. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="intro" id="bran">
        <h2> Elon Musk as Bran Stark</h2>
        <p>Bran has visions. He’s learning clairvoyance. As the Three-Eyed Raven, he is now harnessing magic that fans hope will save the world. Similarly, Musk has been instrumental in developing commercial solar-energy programs for homes and businesses, the integration of solar power with an electric-car battery, and a solar-powered, 28-seat pod that moves at high speeds through a giant tube.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="intro" id="cersei">
        <h2> The Koch Brothers as Cersei Lannister</h2>
        <p>Cersei Lannister schemes to gain power and will destroy anything to keep it. Here’s another wasting-natural-resources comparison: presumably, Cersei could have used all that wildfire against the White Walkers, or at least to keep dead bodies from becoming wights. One could also argue that there is a bit of Cersei in all of us: we’re unwilling to give up the power we receive from cheap fuel, and our children are the ones who will suffer.</p>
